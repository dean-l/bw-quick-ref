I recommend that Lawbreaker come along with any and all choices, but it is not required. Once the nature of the possession is determined, the player and the GM need to devise a separate set of Beliefs and Instincts for the possessing spirit. When these come into conflict with the character's own BITs, a versus Will test must be made-- the spirit against the character. Use the appropriate Will from the stat blocks in the MOnster Burner. Whoever wins the test can enact his Belief or Instinct. A Possessed person can be exercised as per the Faith mechanics in the Burning Wheel. Whether or not he wants to be exorcised is another matter.

Void Embrace is an emotional attribute with its own shade and exponent. It is used to resist tax, sustain spells (rather than Will), and is used to maintain a spell after a distraction. Any Orc may be taught the Rituals, but without Void Embrace, he cannot resist the tax and thus will be permanently crippled or worse. Void Embrace can also be used to enhance certain rolls by spending a persona point to tap the Void. See the Void Embrace section of the Orc chapter for more details. If Void Embrace is advanced to exponent 10, the Orc goes mad or commits suicide. Either way he is removed from play."
